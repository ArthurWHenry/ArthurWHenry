## Introduction

### Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer based out in Maitland, Florida. I primarily use JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and a little bit of SQL through work and projects. As of right now, the framework I've been using is Reactâ€“along with TailwindCSS, to make applications look inviting.

I've always had an appreciation for web development and the endless amount of creativity you can put into it. Soon this passion grew into developing and designing applications. It's always been a space for me to explore that creativity while still being technical.
